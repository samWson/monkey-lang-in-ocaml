# Monkey Lang in OCaml

This is an interpreter for the Monkey programming language written in OCaml. This project follows the code examples in the books [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) and [Writing A Compiler In Go](https://compilerbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball.

## Project Status

As of 24/11/2019 I have left this project as it is. I need more fundamental experience writing OCaml. Usually I am getting hung up on syntax errors and incorrect type signatures.
